            The origin of hamburger is unknown, but the hamburger patty and
            sandwich were probably brought by 19th-century German immigrants
            to the United States, where in a matter of decades the hamburger
            came to be considered an archetypal American food.

            2000–3000 years later. Archaeological evidence supports domestic
            chickens in Southeast Asia well before 6000 BC, China by 6000 BC
            and India by 2000 BC.

            most popular hot drink in the world. Seeds of the Coffea plant's
            fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans.

            A salad is a serving in a meal that includes leaf vegetables such
            as lettuce, spinach, or arugula. Uncooked or cold cooked
            vegetables that are sliced into small pieces (for example tomato
            or onion) are then mixed with the leaf vegetables. Some salads use
            cheese like Greek salad uses Feta.
